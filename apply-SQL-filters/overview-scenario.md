## **Activity Overview**

---

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using SQL. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. 

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about using the AND, OR, and NOT operators in SQL to filter for information. You will explain the queries you performed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## **Scenario**

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.
