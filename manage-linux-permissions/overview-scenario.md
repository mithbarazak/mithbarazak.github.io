# Portfolio Activity: Use Linux commands to manage file permissions

## **Activity Overview**

# **![][image1]**

In this activity, you will create a new portfolio document to demonstrate your experience using Linux commands to manage file permissions. You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. 

To create your portfolio document, you will review a scenario and follow a series of steps. This scenario is connected to the lab you have just completed about how to examine and manage file permissions. You will explain the commands you used in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.

Be sure to complete this activity and answer the questions that follow before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## **Scenario**

# **![][image2]**

Review the scenario below. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
